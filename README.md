# EyeConic: AI-Powered Vision Health Assistant

### Overview
Millions of people suffer from undiagnosed vision problems, particularly in areas with limited access to healthcare professionals. This project aims to build an **AI-powered virtual assistant** that uses **Machine Learning (ML)**, **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, and **Computer Vision (CV)** to detect early signs of eye conditions. By enabling users to conduct basic tests and describe symptoms from home, our solution can assist in early diagnosis and suggest professional consultations when necessary.

---

### Problem Statement
Many people delay getting their eyes checked until a problem becomes severe, leading to more complicated treatment and higher costs. This issue is particularly critical in **low-resource settings** where healthcare infrastructure is minimal, and eye care services are difficult to access.

---

### Solution
The **AI-Powered Vision Health Assistant** helps users perform self-diagnosis through image-based assessments and symptom checks. It integrates cutting-edge technologies to deliver an intelligent and holistic eye health assistant.

---

### Key Features

1. **Image-Based Diagnosis (Computer Vision):**
   - Users can take pictures of their eyes using a high resolution smartphone camera, or proper laboratory camera
   - The AI analyzes these images to detect common eye problems such as redness, cataracts, and other visible abnormalities.
   - The system can also run basic vision tests for issues like strabismus or nystagmus.


3. **Machine Learning-Powered Recommendations:**
   - The system refines its recommendations over time using ML algorithms that learn from user inputs and image data.
   - Suggestions include recommendations for professional appointments in high-risk cases.

4. **Integration with Wearable Devices:**
   - Future aspects include potential integration with **AR glasses** or **smart contact lenses** to provide real-time eye health feedback, posture correction, and alerts for excessive screen time.

---

### Impact
By democratizing eye care, this project offers early diagnosis and preventive solutions, particularly for individuals in rural and underserved areas. It leverages **ML, NLP, and CV technologies** to provide accessible, at-home vision care.

---

### Technologies

- **Computer Vision:** OpenCV, TensorFlow, or PyTorch for image processing and analysis.
- **Machine Learning:** Continuous learning models to improve diagnosis accuracy.
- **Wearable Integration (Future Scope):** Compatibility with AR glasses or smart contact lenses for real-time feedback.
